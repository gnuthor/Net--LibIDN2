Net/LibIDN2 version 0.03
========================

This module provides Perl bindings for GNU Libidn2 by Simon Josefsson
(http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/) and closely follows
the original C API of that library.

Please note that as of Jan 5th 2013, libidn2 doesn't appear to be fully 
functional yet (see IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP regression test), so please
consider this a development release with a potentially unstable API.

Developed against pre-release git tree of libidn2 (internal
version 0.9).

INSTALLATION

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

If your local version of GNU Libidn2 is installed in a non-standard
location, try the following instead of "perl Build.PL":

perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags=-I/path/include --extra_linker_flags="-L/path/lib -lidn2"

Should your runtime library search path not contain libidn2, you probably will
have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or compile the absolute library path into
the module like follows:

perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags=-I/path/include --extra_linker_flags="-L/path/lib -lidn2 -Wl,-rpath=/path/lib"

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  GNU Libidn2 >=0.8
