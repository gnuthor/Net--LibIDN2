Please note that as of Jan 5th 2013, GNU libidn2 isn't actually 
fully functional yet, so consider this a development
release with an unstable API.

Developed against pre-release git tree of libidn2 (internal
version 0.9)

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

If your local version of GNU Libidn2 is installed in a non-standard
location, try the following instead of "perl Build.PL":

perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags=-I/path/include --extra_linker_flags="-L/path/lib -lidn2"

Should your runtime library search path not contain libidn2, you probably will
have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or compile the absolute library path into
the module like follows:

perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags=-I/path/include --extra_linker_flags="-L/path/lib -lidn2 -Wl,-rpath=/path/lib"
