Net/LibIDN2 version 1.01
========================

This module provides Perl bindings for GNU Libidn2 by Simon Josefsson
(http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/) and closely follows
the original C API of that library.

Devel-CheckLib-1.11 in directory inc, by Yasuhiro Matsumoto, is
included as is to facilitate cpantesters.org build testing.

INSTALLATION

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

If your local version of GNU Libidn2 is installed in a non-standard
location, try the following instead of "perl Build.PL":

perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags=-I/path/include --extra_linker_flags="-L/path/lib -lidn2"

Should your runtime library search path not contain libidn2, you probably will
have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or compile the absolute library path into
the module like follows:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/lib perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags=-I/path/include --extra_linker_flags="-L/path/lib -lidn2"

or

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/lib perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags=-I/path/include --extra_linker_flags="-L/path/lib -lidn2 -Wl,-rpath=/path/lib"

Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH *and* rpath might be necessary to make Devel::CheckLib detect the
presence of libidn2 correctly.
